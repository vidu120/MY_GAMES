# MY_GAMES
Hey there ,this project contains some of the games that i have remade from the scratch which includes flappy bird , pong etc using Love2D framework
with Lua as the backbone.


# To Run
Steps involved
1. Install the love2D framework throught this link - https://love2d.org/
2. Install the required binaries for running code written in Lua language from the link here - https://www.lua.org/download.html
3. After doing the above two steps you can jump straight into any game and go into the final revision of that game , after that you just have 
to open the game directory in the terminal and then type in the (love .) command - {for macOS , windows , linux}- which basically means to launch the game using the lua framework , this command will start up the game by executing the main.lua file
